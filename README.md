Here are the key steps: First, identify your core assumptions about your idea, target customers, and the problem you're solving. Then, conduct customer interviews with potential users to understand their real needs and pain points. I'm asking about your specific idea because the validation approach can vary depending on your target market. What type of business idea are you looking to validate?"
